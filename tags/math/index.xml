      <description>Homogeneous coordinate is a coordinate system that mapping coordinates in $R^n$ space to $R^{n+1}$ space, there are many methods of mapping but the most commonly used one is using $(x_1,y_1,z_1)=(w x_2, w y_2, w z_2)$, and in $R^{n+1}$ space we will have $(x_2,y_2,z_2,\lambda)$.
The benefits of this transformation come from two aspect and it is best to think of them as two different applications of homogeneous coordinate (we typically using projection matrix to convert the first one to the second one, but the $w$ value here means exactly different things, please don&amp;rsquo;t mix up):</description>

      <description>Week 1 For any vector: $$ \overrightarrow{AB}=\overrightarrow{OB}-\overrightarrow{OA} $$ Can be denoted as: $$ \left[ \begin{matrix} b_1 - a_1 \\\ b_2 - a_2 \end{matrix} \right] or \left[ \begin{matrix} b_1 - a_1 , b_2 - a_2 \end{matrix} \right] $$
 $\overrightarrow{OA}$ is the position vector of A. $\overrightarrow{AB}$ is the displacement vector from A to B.  Vector addition supports:
 Commutativity Associativity  Scalar multiplication supports distributivity.
A vector space is a set $V$ that:</description>

      <description>I have written a note about this topic last year, but that was in Chinese, as I&amp;rsquo;m rewriting my blog in English, I think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary make a translation as this one is so important. It is probably the last blog before the end of my this semester examination.
The graphics pipeline can be roughly divide to three steps:
 Application Geometry Rasterization  There is a image of rendering pipeline, it is so perfect but I cannot found the English version of it:</description>
