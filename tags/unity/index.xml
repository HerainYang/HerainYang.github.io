      <description>I was working on my university course project these day, and we are using Unity/C#. For function which isn&amp;rsquo;t return immediately, I used coroutine and yield return waituntil to wait for it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about C# so at that time I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know we have async/await/task, my thinking method is imprisoned in only using Unity API, after reading some article I suddenly realize I should definitely try this async/await/task things.</description>

      <description>Comparing to putting asset inside of Resources folder, using asset bundle system has a lot of benefits. While using resources system, Unity engine will create a index table for all resources inside Resources folder, in order to fasten the speed of Resources.Load. It is really fast but every time we add something into the folder, engine will need to rebuild the table, as the number of resources increase, the table also increase and need a lot of memory.</description>

      <description>About three or four years ago, I was development my first indie game, and my main character have a gun, well if you know something about unity, you know what happened, the bullet go through enemy because of the tunnel effect because of the velocity is too large. At that time I know little about unity so my solution was just slow down the bullet.
However, there is a solution provided by Unity itself somehow I missed it, so I decided to write something about it.</description>
